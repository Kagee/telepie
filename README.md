telepai
==============
Library / GUI / validator for the Telepay 2v1 standard for payment transactions.

Current version (as of 2013-08-08) can display a colorcoded view of important fields in
domestic records. It does basic error checking, but is rather fault-tolerant to
be able to parse files with non-terminating problems (e.g. wrong encoding)
